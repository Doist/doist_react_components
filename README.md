# How to improve

Build the reactist library by running:
```
npm run build
```

During development we recommend to run
```
npm run build-watch
```
This will listen to changes you make and trigger a rebuild of the reactist library. When running an example in parallel it will be updated automagically.

You can run eslint with 
```
npm run check
```
It is mandatory to fix all linting errors before you make a pull request.
