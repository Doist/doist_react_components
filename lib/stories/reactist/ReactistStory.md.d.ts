declare const developmentText = "\n    First clone the repository to your local machine by running:\n    ```sh\n    git clone git@github.com:Doist/reactist.git\n    ```\n\n    We identified two major modes of development for Reactist. First, running an interactive storybook and see the changes you make to a component in an isolated environment. This is especially helpful when developing new components. And second, improving existing components in real-life applications.\n\n    #### Storybook\n\n    For the first development mode run:\n    ```sh\n    npm run storybook\n    ```\n    This boots up a development server with hot reloading on http://localhost:6006. You can iterate on the components in the existing stories or add a completely new one.\n\n    #### Inside your application\n\n    For the second development mode you can leverage\n    ```sh\n    npm link\n    ```\n    First run:\n    ```sh\n    npm run build-watch\n    ```\n    this will update the build artifacts whenever you change something.\n\n    In your real application you need to first delete the current *@doist/reactist* dependency and then link to your local one.\n    ```sh\n    cd ~/your-app\n    # delete current reactist dependency\n    rm -rf ./node_modules/@doist/reactist\n\n    # link local reactist version\n    npm link ../reactist\n    ```\n    The relative path to reactist may need to be changed to match your local environment.\n\n    To undo the changes and switch back to the reactist version from npm do the following:\n    ```sh\n    cd ~/your-app\n    # first remove linked reactist dependency\n    rm -rf ./node_modules/@doist/reactist\n\n    # re-install reactist from npm (-E avoids updating the version / package-lock.json)\n    npm install -E @doist/reactist\n    ```\n\n    ### Development tips and tricks\n\n    Independent of the development you operate in to produce a new build (e.g. before submitting a PR) run:\n    ```sh\n    npm run build\n    ```\n    **Note:** This will **not** update the docs. In case you want to update the docs you need to run:\n    ```sh\n    npm run build-storybook\n    ```\n\n\n    You can run our eslint checks with\n    ```sh\n    npm run check\n    ```\n    It is mandatory to fix all linting errors before you make a pull request.\n\n    **Tip:** You can fix most of the errors automatically by running:\n    ```sh\n    npm run check -- --fix\n    ```\n";
declare const testingText = "\n    Tests are executed with jest or by running:\n    ```sh\n    npm run test\n    ```\n\n    During development you may find it beneficial to continuously execute the tests. This works by running:\n    ```sh\n    npm run test-watch\n    ```\n    This also prints the current test coverage.\n\n    MacOS users might need to upgrade watchman with\n    ```\n    brew install watchman\n    ```\n    when experiencing troubles with the watch mode.
